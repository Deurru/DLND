# DLND
Final projects for each of the lessons of Udacity´s Deep Learning Nanodegree with PyTorch. Here you can find:
- **dog_app**: a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that classifies dog images by breed, or identifies humans with the dog breed they look most similar to.
- **dlnd_tv_script_generation**: a TV script generator based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a Seinfeld script´s dataset. The model uses tokenization and word embeddings to learn how to randomly produce sentences in sitcom-script format.
- **dlnd_face_generation**: a model that generates faces using a deep-convoluctional adversarial generative network (DCGAN).
- **SageMaker_Project**: en example of deployment of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The deployment includes a simple web app, and is done using Amazon Web Services SageMaker platform.
